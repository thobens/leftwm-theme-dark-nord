### adding glyphs

One thing you can always do is just ask me to add a glyph. I'll do my best to react to demands, but since I'm doing this in my free time a cannot make guarantees.

If you want to add glyphs yourself: Since my app of choice (glyphs) is closed source and paid, and all open font development seems to happen with fontforge, I created an ufo version of the regular version of the font. Fontforge knows how to handle these.

Please just use this version for contributions. The dimensions of typical elements are:

The corners are rounded with a radius 25 points, the glyph width is 575 points.

I'll import the contributions in regular intervals, check the outlines, create bold and italic versions of them and update the upstream version. 

Contributions don't have to be release-ready. I'm happy to adjust curves, round the corners etc. If you need help, just ask. Fontdesign is fun, and I'm happy to help.



Again, if I react slowly, do not take it personally. I appreciate any help, suggestions and feedback, but sometimes I cannot react on the same day.
